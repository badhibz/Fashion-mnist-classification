# Fashion-mnist-classification
Deep learning-based clothing image classification using Fashion MNIST with TensorFlow, Streamlit, and MLflow.

This project showcases the use of deep learning to classify clothing images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. It includes EDA, training a CNN, and logging experiments with MLflow. A Streamlit interface is also available for interactive testing.

## Objectives
- Visualize and explore the Fashion MNIST dataset
- Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow
- Track experiments using MLflow
- Deploy an interactive demo with Streamlit

## Class Labels
- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- Streamlit for app deployment

## Status
Model training complete â€“ Streamlit app available locally.
